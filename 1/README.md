react is a javascript library but it gives directly takkar to framework like angular. As its competition is directly with angular and vue js like frameworks that's why it is honoured/refered as a framework by some people

react => component based architecture

react website is a chunks of react components. eg. -> navbar is a component, left screen is a component and the right screen may be divided into two components like upper and lower

if nodemodules gets deleted just write npm i means npm install it will recreate all the things again

npm -> package manager -> download anything permanently => takes faltu ki storage.
npx -> you can use package without downloading it means takes as a tenancy without permanently downloading it in out system storage
so better to use npx

prop and state
react components are in src folder and send props in that components and there is a state of those components

components ke props and components ki state

props -> details that are needed to be filled inside component is called props. eg. -> form is made which has name address etc fields -> i will fill this form form is component, details inside component means in this form is props
state -> form name is my form its the heading of the form. That my form that is the heading of the form is our state now you can change the state means heading here in this example.
state of a component means details and props means that by sending props we can change the awastha of the component
