jsx -> ek html jisne js ka mukut pehna hua hai
khasiyat of jsx -> hum iske andar hi js use kar sakte hai => matlab ki html bhi and js bhi

jsx -> syntax extension of js in which you write html and embed js inside curly braces

difference:-
tab -> tabIndex
class -> className
for -> htmlFor

in react,
    when we are using jsx, we can only return only one element/block
    means
    return(
        <h1>Hello Hye Bye Bye</h1>
        <h2>Jarur</h2>
    ) gives an error 
    where as 
    return(
        <h1>Hello Hye Bye Bye</h1>
    ) works finely
    also
    return(
        <>
            <h1>Hello Hye Bye Bye</h1>
            <h2>Jarur</h2>
        </>
    ) also works finely beacause now only one component is getting returned.<></> => jsx fragmanet in place of jsx fragment we can also use div the point is that we only have to send/return one element

unterminated jsx content is not allowed in jsx syntax

the jsx that we write is compiled by babel into proper javascript. resolved into react.createElement call    






import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

let name = "xyz"
let name = "<b>xyz</b>"  -> <b>xyz</b> yahi print ho jayega html rendering nahi hogi

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Hello {name}</h1> -> {name} it is working as javascript and it gets resolved
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
